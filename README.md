# DemoTest-

Note:

1. Due to time constraint the "User validates the cart summary" is not implemented
2.  We can get the text from UI and add them into Hash Map 
3.  and add the blue dress to cart
4.  In cart summary page again we can get text from UI and add to another hash map
5.  we can compare maps to see if the data is same/not		

My Assumptions are :

The framework can be enhanced to capable of running same test on multiple environments(like dev,sit etc)
External reporting can be added(like extent)
I have created the step definitions for each line in the test which can be optimized later using scenario outline or other excel capabilities.

Note: Due to time constraints I haven't added the screen shots and reports(like Extent reports) and I did test from my personal computer so may be it will show different name in GIT while commit so please ignore it.
